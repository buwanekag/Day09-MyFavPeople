### MyFavPeople

Yeah, there's a million to do contact apps on the app store, but given your success with GetItDone, you think you can extend it to your contacts.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* Create a ‘contact list’ app called MyFavPeople using Core Data
* The contacts must at least have a first name, last name, address info, phone number, eMail, Skype ID, and Twitter ID
* The contacts must have at least one one-to-many relationship. Some suggestions might be addresses, phones, or email
* Use a TableView to display the list
* Users should be able to Add or Edit (and save, of course) items from a detail view that uses a table view to display/edit the data

OPTIONAL hard mode for this assignment:
Add Categories (Friends, Family, etc) that the user can maintain and can optionally sort by them in list view
